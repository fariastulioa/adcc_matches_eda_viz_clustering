    "This notebook contains exploration and analysis of data on athletes who competed in the ADCC grappling championship, focusing on visualization.  \n",
    "It also includes the use of said data to train an unsupervised model (KMeans) to group athletes in clusters. The idea is for this to make some trends and relationships visible that were not easily perceivable in the original data.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Sports fans in general tend to be very passionate when discussing fighters and specialized media usually craft and push specific narratives to the public. The goal of this notebook is to generate data based insights to be compared to what is commonly perceived in this context as truth about specific athletes, styles, eras and more. That way, different stories can be told relying less on subjective perceptions, emotional reactions and personal preferences."
