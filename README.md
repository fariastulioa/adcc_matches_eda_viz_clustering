# adcc_matches_eda_viz_clustering
Analysis, visualizations and KMeans clustering using data from submission grappling matches of ADCC events from 1998 to 2022


This is an interactive Python notebook, which is also available on Kaggle where it can be directly run using any web browser.  
Code cells are collapsed by default there, but can be expanded with a single click if you're interested in the code.  
If you just want to see the results from my analysis, the notebook is well organized for casual viewers.  
Since the plots there are interactive, you can mouse over any portion of them to reveal details about it, zoom in or out and redefine the scope of what's being displayed.

If there's any specific visualization or analysis you want to see done but don't know how, feel free to leave a comment there.
If you want to download the data to analyze it yourself, it's also available for free at the Kaggle link under 'Input'.
Thanks for the support!
